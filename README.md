# Hello_world
First Try to create a repository
Hello Human!
  This is my first test on GitHub, I hope I can make progress here with all you guys help.I like the style of GitHub, and there are many more English words I can not understand. I suppose it is a hard way for me to be skillful to the platform. And I will try.
  On the other hand, I want provided my hand to IronHan, my girlfriend. It is another motivation I learn code.
